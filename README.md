ðŸ§  DeepFake Detection: Harnessing Neural Networks for Digital Image Integrity
This research investigates advanced methods for detecting deepfake content by leveraging deep neural networks. With the growing sophistication of synthetic media generation, ensuring the authenticity of digital images has become a critical challenge. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning to extract robust features from facial images and detect subtle artifacts introduced by generative models.

Key Contributions:

Developed a CNN-based pipeline optimized for deepfake image classification.

Employed transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-50) for improved accuracy and training efficiency.

Evaluated performance using benchmark datasets such as FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepFakeDetection.

Achieved competitive accuracy and generalization across unseen fake generation techniques.
